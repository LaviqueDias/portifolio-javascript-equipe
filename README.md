# Portfolio Website - Team Project

This project was created as part of Programming in Interpreted Languages course.
The objective was to form teams of three members and develop a website that serves as a portfolio for each member.

Each team member has their own section where they introduce themselves, describe the technologies they work with, and showcase their projects.

## üìå Project Structure

The website is divided into the following sections:

- **Header**: with navigation links to other sections.
- **Hero**: introduction banner
- **About Us**: describing our team
- **Team Members Sections**: one section for each of the three members
- **Newsletter**: includes a subscription form (form validation implemented, but no actual email sending)
- **Footer**: with additional navigation links and team contact information

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Organization
